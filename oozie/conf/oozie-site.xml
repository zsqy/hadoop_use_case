            used when there is no exact match for an authority. The HADOOP_CONF_DIR contains
            the relevant Hadoop *-site.xml files. If the path is relative is looked within
            the Oozie configuration directory; though the path can be absolute (i.e. to point
            to Hadoop client conf/ directories in the local filesystem.
